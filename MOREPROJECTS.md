Version 1 of Alfe AI (https://alfe.sh)

Available At: https://github.com/alfe-ai/Sterling

Alfe AI - Sterling is a self-hostable AI-powered coding assistant I built to act as a “co-developer,” turning natural language into working code.

It uses OpenAI/OpenRouter GPT/DeepSeek/Codex and multi-model support to generate, modify, and debug code with specialized prompts for clean, ready-to-use output.

Integrated into CLI/UI workflows, with a custom bash-based shell called AlSH, it automates boilerplate, new modules, and improvements.

Includes quality checks, test runs, and Git integration for reliable, production-ready results.

Tech stack: Node.js, Python, OpenAI APIs, JSON/REST.

For my senior thesis (B.S. Computer Science, UIUC) I built an autonomous UAV that patrols and detects humans.

Available at: https://github.com/lochner-technology/secdrone

A Raspberry Pi runs a secure WiFi access point and Python web app with Google Maps integration to send the drone to GPS waypoints, set speed/altitude, and patrol routes.

A camera feed is processed with OpenCV using HOG + Linear SVM to detect humans, triggering email alerts.

Tech stack: Raspberry Pi, Python, OpenCV, Google Maps API, WiFi AP.
