Version 1 of Alfe AI (https://alfe.sh)

Available At: https://github.com/alfe-ai/Sterling

Alfe AI - Sterling is a self-hostable AI-powered coding assistant I built to act as a “co-developer,” turning natural language into working code.

It uses OpenAI/OpenRouter GPT/DeepSeek/Codex and multi-model support to generate, modify, and debug code with specialized prompts for clean, ready-to-use output.

Integrated into CLI/UI workflows, with a custom bash-based shell called AlSH, it automates boilerplate, new modules, and improvements.

Includes quality checks, test runs, and Git integration for reliable, production-ready results.

Tech stack: Node.js, Python, OpenAI APIs, JSON/REST.

For my senior thesis (B.S. Computer Science, UIUC) I built an autonomous UAV that patrols and detects humans.

Available at: https://github.com/lochner-technology/secdrone

A Raspberry Pi runs a secure WiFi access point and Python web app with Google Maps integration to send the drone to GPS waypoints, set speed/altitude, and patrol routes.

A camera feed is processed with OpenCV using HOG + Linear SVM to detect humans, triggering email alerts.

Tech stack: Raspberry Pi, Python, OpenCV, Google Maps API, WiFi AP.

### AlSH Shell & Debian Derivative

<img width="500" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9931aa20-b472-45cf-832e-0ca27c4276eb" />

AlSH custom Bash shell and Faybian OS - Debian Derivative

Available at: https://github.com/faybian-os

Faybian OS is a Debian-based development environment I built for easier software development.

Features AlSH, the Bash-based shell for assisted software development.

Automated Bash scripts provision QEMU/KVM VMs, install Debian, configure users, SSH, dev tools.

Ensures reproducible setups across local and cloud, with isolated VMs for safe testing.

Includes scripts for VM snapshots, resets, and network config.

Tech stack: Debian, Bash, QEMU/KVM, Linux networking.

Alfe AI integration with AlSH shell is planned. (https://alfe.sh)
