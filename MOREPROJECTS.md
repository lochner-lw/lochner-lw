Version 1 of Alfe AI (https://alfe.sh)

Available At: https://github.com/alfe-ai/Sterling

Alfe AI - Sterling is a self-hostable AI-powered coding assistant I built to act as a “co-developer,” turning natural language into working code.

It uses OpenAI/OpenRouter GPT/DeepSeek/Codex and multi-model support to generate, modify, and debug code with specialized prompts for clean, ready-to-use output.

Integrated into CLI/UI workflows, with a custom bash-based shell called AlSH, it automates boilerplate, new modules, and improvements.

Includes quality checks, test runs, and Git integration for reliable, production-ready results.

Tech stack: Node.js, Python, OpenAI APIs, JSON/REST.
